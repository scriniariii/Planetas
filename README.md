# Planetas
This project is a space simulator developed in C++ using the Raylib library. The goal is to create a realistic representation of the solar system and space in general, where users can explore different planets and understand their dynamics in a 3D environment.

# Art
The space simulator will adopt a low-poly artistic style, characterized by simplified and geometric 3D models. This approach is not only aesthetically appealing but also provides several advantages. I lack the resources for realistic art and my PC's processing power is really limited, making this style a practical choice. Additionally, I genuinely enjoy how it looks.

# Upcoming features:

- Manual Planet Generation: Users will be able to define and create planets by customizing their properties..
  
- Procedural Planet Generation: Implement algorithms that randomly generate planets with different characteristics (size, color, texture).
  
- Realistic Physics: Integrate a physics system that simulates gravity, planetary orbits and other dynamic effects.

- Black Holes: Introduce black holes that affect the trajectory of nearby planets and offer a deeper exploration experience.
